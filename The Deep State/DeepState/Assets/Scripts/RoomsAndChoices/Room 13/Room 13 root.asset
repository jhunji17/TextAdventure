  - text: As you enter the room, you are confronted with the strangest sight -- A
      teenage girl is lying on the bed, in what appears to be a typical teenage bedroom.
      However, she appears to be a lion from the waist down, and poking out of a
      t-shirt are a pair of eagle wings. Horrified, you turn to run, but the girl
      takes off her headphones and addresses you.
  - text: 'Weird teenage creature: "Where do you think you''re going?! You interrupted
      my song."'
