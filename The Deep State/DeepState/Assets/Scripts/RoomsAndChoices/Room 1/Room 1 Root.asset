  - text: After walking down a long corridor you eventually find yourselves in a
      small room. Two skeletons lie in the middle of the room, both face down towards
      you, arms outstretched. From their clothes they look like priests of some kind.
      Suddenly you hear an ominous crash in the distance, and then the unmistakable
      thud, thud, thud of footsteps, coming from a corridor on the left. A small
      door can be made out on your right.
