  - text: "The room you\u2019ve entered is dim, but you can see it is fairly spacious.
      In the darkness you can\r make out a slab of stone and unlit candles\u2014it
      appears to be an altar of some kind. You are about to step forward when the
      room bursts with light. The candles have been lit, and you see now that you
      are not alone. Priest like figures emerge from their shadowed crevices. With
      them,\r held back by a chain, is a snarling creature with distinctive yellow
      eyes."
  - text: "\u201CAre you worthy?\u201D one\r of the priests asks. \u201CWe will see.\u201D
      The priest holding the creature\u2019s speaks from beneath her\r hood, \u201COur
      eudaemon will sniff out your spirit. If the stink of ill will has not yet tainted
      your soul,\r you may pass on freely from here.\u201D She lets go of the chain
      and creature makes its way toward\r you, but slowly. You sense that you must
      be compliant, and very, very still. Who knows what could set it off?"
