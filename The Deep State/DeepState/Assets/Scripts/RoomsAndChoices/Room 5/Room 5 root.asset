  - text: The corridor eventually leads to the entrance to a cave. Seeing no other
      exits, you press on. As you walk in, a chill breeze blows through, carrying
      the smell of moss and the stench of wet fur. Determined, you go deeper in and
      the cave gets darker and colder. You begin to hear a deep rumbling sound. Suddenly
      you trip over something on the ground, an unlit torch.
