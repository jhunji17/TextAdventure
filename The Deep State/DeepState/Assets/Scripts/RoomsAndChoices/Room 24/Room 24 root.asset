  - text: You enter the room, and are faced with a bizarre sight. A plinth stands
      in the center of the room, made of dark black stone upon which rests a crystal
      skull. In a circle around the skull are candles glowing with an eerie purple
      flame. All else except one, next to which rests a torch with a similar flame.
      Surrounding the candles are skeletons, and there appear to be old weapons like
      swords and bows. Ahead, you see can see another door.
