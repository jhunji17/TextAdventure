      your shoes across\r its mortar. You continue forward. A ways ahead, suspended
      within a jump\u2019s\r reach above the bridge is a small bag. As you get nearer,
      a loud crumbling directs your\r attention behind you. The bridge\u2019s support
      has given way, and everything\r behind you is beginning to fall. You have to
      run!"
