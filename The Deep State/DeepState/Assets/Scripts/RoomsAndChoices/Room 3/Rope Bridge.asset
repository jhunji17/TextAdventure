      wood boards\r creak beneath you. You continue forward. A ways ahead, suspended
      within a jump\u2019s\r reach above the bridge is a small satchel. As you close
      in on what may be a bag of\r goodies, you hear a snap behind you. The bridge\u2019s
      rope has broken, and everything\r behind you is beginning to fall. You have
      to run!"
