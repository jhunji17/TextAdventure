  - text: After walking down the long corridor you eventually find yourselves in
      front of a small wooden door. Without knocking, you enter and find a small
      room, lit by a small torch with a flickering purple flame. A very very old
      man sits in the corner on a bed, and he Is holding a pistol to his head. Around
      him lies climbing gear, such as harnesses and bags of chalk. On the far side
      of the room lies an open door, and a cold wind blows through. Upon seeing you
      he puts the gun down and looks at you inquisitively.
