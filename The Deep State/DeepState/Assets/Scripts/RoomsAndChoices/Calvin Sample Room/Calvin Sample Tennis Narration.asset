  - text: lit.
  - text: We will have decision points like the one you just saw that controls where
      in the story you progress (not just 2-way decisions in the final product, possibly
      up to 8-way paths)
  - text: With all that being said, we are having trouble with deciding the art style
      because we do not have an artist on the team.
  - text: 'We are leaning towards one of two options: a fantasy-themed adventure
      or a more simple ominous white text on black sort of minimalist aesthetic focusing
      more on having a nice atmosphere'
  - text: Which sounds more your style?
