  - text: You are now in the first sample room. Amazing
  - text: It doesn't look like much yet but we are working on it. We now have the
      basic parts setup so that entire rooms can be made in minutes. We just need
      to flesh out the story/art. So I'm just going to explain our current goal for
      the game in case you do not know yet.
  - text: What do you get when you cross a visual novel with jackbox?
  - text: Hopefully this game.
  - text: Visual novel in that it looks and feels like a visual novel...
  - text: And Jackbox in that it will be multiplayer on one screen (although not
      through your phones-- dont know how to do that)
  - text: Players will take turns choosing their own route through the story and
      occasionally have interesting minigames /tasks / punishments to perform in
      real life (such as doing a dare, taking a shot, idk we are working on it)
  - text: And hopefully also be somewhat like mario party with virtual minigames
      as well if we can manage.
  - text: Sound ok?
