  - text: As you walk into the room you hear high pitched screams of rage. The floor
      is littered with various tools, everything from hammers to chainsaws. At the
      far end of the room a tiny creature is hacking away at a giant boulder twice
      his size with an axe. "No, No, No!" it screams, but the axe barely leaves a
      scratch on the boulder.
