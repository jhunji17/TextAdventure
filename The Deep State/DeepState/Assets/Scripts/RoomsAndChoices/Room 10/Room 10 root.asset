  description: 
  pages:
  - text: You stumble into a room, dazed and injured, and are suddenly hit by the
      glare of bright flourescent light. The room appears to be a modern day lab,
      microscopes and electrical equipment line the walls. In the middle of the room
      lie four test tubes. As you walk towards the center of the room you hear the
      quiet whir of motors, and you turn to see mounted cameras in the corners of
      the room, following your every move. Next to the test tubes lies a small note.
  - text: You open the note.
