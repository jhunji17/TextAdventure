  - text: "As you catch your breath from the last encounter, you hear a cacophony
      of ticking sounds all\r around you. The walls, the ceiling, and the floor are
      all covered in clocks. Maybe even made out of clocks. Each with its own unsynchronized
      tick. Three huge stone clocks embedded into\r the floor provide the deepest
      and most resounding of the ticks echoing around you. "

      inscription: \u201CFeeling \u2018out of time\u2019? To\r find your way back
      to your goal, listen and stand upon the stone clock whose tick is true.\u201D"
