  - text: You find yourselves in a dark misty cavern, the air is damp, and there
      is a foul odor. You look around at each other, tension palpable in the room.
      In front of you lie two large stone arches. One is open and leads into a dark
      corridor, and the other is blocked by large stones.
  - text: A tiny gap can be seen in the top right, and a hint of light seems to be
      shining through. There is also an ominous hole in the middle of the ground
      that seems to lead to a chute of some kind.
